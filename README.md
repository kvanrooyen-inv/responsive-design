# Responsive Design

These three examples are being used as part of a workshop on responsive design.

1. **Responsive:**
    - This is when the site looks good on all devices.
    - [Example](https://kvanrooyen-inv.github.io/responsive-design/responsive/responsive_dashboard.html)

2. **Somewhat Responsive:**
    - This is when it may appear to be fully responsive at first glance but something doesn't quite work (e.g. you may need to scroll horizontally to see certain content).
    - [Example](https://kvanrooyen-inv.github.io/responsive-design/somewhat-responsive/somewhat_responsive_dashboard.html)

3. **Not Responsive:**
    - This is when there has been no consideration for other screen sizes (e.g. everything is really small on mobile).
    - [Example](https://kvanrooyen-inv.github.io/responsive-design/not-responsive/not_responsive_dashboard.html)
